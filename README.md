## Dev Challenge 1 : Uploading and processing the .msg file in Django

- Approach 1 
	Uploading the file, storing it in upload directory and then reading the file. 

- Approach 2 
	Uploading file and reading it directly from post data without storing it in memory and displaying the data.

- Tried to implement the second approach.

- Clone this repo to your system.

- Create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Start the python server, `python3 manage.py runserver`.

- Go to `localhost:8000` or '127.0.0.1:8000' and upload the `test.msg` file.

- Content will be displayed on "index.html" page.

## Dev Challenge 2 : Django web application to open ssh connection using ip/username/password fields and generate the metric report

- This one is implemented to some extent but data is not in a proper readable format

- Content will be displayed on "metric.html" page.

Note : all above code written by taking help of many google sites, since I never wrote a code in python before and newbie to this, faced few difficulties to setup an environment as well as to debug and fix the syntax issues as well
